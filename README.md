# Tailor-Management
The proposed online tailoring management system is a computerized system that aims to automate the current manual tailoring process and improve the management of information for customers and decision making. The system will allow customers to register online and submit their measurements, check the status of their orders, and get information about the cost of their garments. It will also enable the system administrator to manage customer information and update records. The system will provide data security, data integrity, and quick search capabilities, as well as a paperless environment. It will help improve the speed and efficiency of the tailoring process and provide customers with more convenience and accessibility. Overall, the online tailoring management system aims to improve the tailoring sector by providing a more efficient and modern way of managing customer orders and information.
